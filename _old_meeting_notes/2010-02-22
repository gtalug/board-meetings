= Executive Meeting for February =

== Prep For Upcoming Meetings ==

  * Meetings scheduled until late in 2010
  * [ticket:9 September] & [ticket:12 December] currently not planned out
  * [ticket:9 September]: possibly on high performance web sites
  * [ticket:12 December]: possibly scripting language "smackdown"

  * Better signage for meetings would be good, but we want to be a bit subtle; big sign downstairs is probably more than we ought to consider!  Calling that much attention mightn't be a good thing.
  * Default room is usually 244

  * Some concern expressed at the perceived underrepresentation of women at GTALUG.  Percentages do appear rather low.  There are reasons for this to not be over-surprising, but it is...
  * Might want to contact GeekGirls, indicating that we may have things to offer

== OGLF ==

  * Possibly not the best acronym...
  * Coming time to "poke" the committee
    * Need much better location
    * Possibly too late to change location for 2010
    * Colin observes that SF cons need to book locations 2 years in advance
    * Contact them to indicate possibilities:
      * We saw lot of complaints about location
      * Suggest U(T) location
      * Propose July timing
      * Colin & Bill think they have good relations with them, to contact about this...

== IT360 ==

  * Deprecated
  * Off topic thing to do - Myles

== Other Conferences ==

  * OLS in Ottawa (except when in Montreal)
  * FSOSS at Seneca
  * Proclamation from David Miller re Open Source Week (Oct 24-31, 2009).  Almost certainly arranged by FSOSS folks.

== ICANN ==

  * Myles is accidentally on two subcommittees
    * One to suggest voting procedures for ACLAC
    * Now designing a brochure for NORALO - North American At Large Organization
  * Trying to convince Evan that we should be trying to influence people, not organizations.  In effect, we should be explaining what ICANN is...

== Web Site Things ==

  * Some updates to front page; looking good!
  * Nice pointer to Other Groups
  * Probably ought to add "sponsors" link in the left column
    * SS.org
    * MonkeyInYourSoul
    * InterLink

== Marketing Initiatives ==
  * Stupid Sponsorship Idea
     Wear shirts with sponsors names and take off shirts in the course of the presentation
  * Should promote membership harder
  * Need to identify purpose more clearly...
  * If something happens by next month re GetInvolved.ca for Toronto Freenet, then we might consider further discussion of it.
