== Board Changes ==

 * Farewell, and thanks, to Seneca
 * Welcome to the returning Chris + Scott
 * Welcome back, William Park
 * Note that Ivan + Colin are the other two board members

== Proxy ==

 * Proxy statement needs to be reasonably direct
 * And it seems it is...
 * Myles is filling in for Colin Capruscu this year

== Location ==

 * Executive meeting now taking place at Scott Sullivan's place
 * Deferring official address changes (Bank, Corporate docs) until/unless there is actually need
 * Boxes will get moved to Scott's place
 * We should trash trashable things; most of the box contents should be pretty irrelevant

 * November - Rob Gelson on 3D CAD for use in 3D printer stack
 * December - solicit from members, "What's exciting you about Linux these days?"
 * January - Madison Kelly, Clustering Redux
 * Some time: Achmed (coworker of Bill Thanis) on animation tools

 * Highly desirable to have a slate of 3 talks for the next quarter that may be used for publicity
 * Want to publish talks on video
   * Streaming live from location
   * YouTube "GTALUG" channel
   * Note legality issue: need signoff from speakers for this to work

== Meeting Space/Plans ==

 * Bigger room
   * No new changes
   * No feedback from Ryerson (notably Peter @ Student Union)
   * Peter invited to meetings (both Exec & the public meeting)
 * Projector - still needs to be brought for now...
   * HDMI adaptor in place
 * Collecting statistics on attendance
   * Should add a wiki page with a table for this

== Executive Election ==
 * Secretary/Treasurer: Chris Browne
 * Chairman of Board: Scott Sullivan
 * President: Scott Sullivan
 * PR Committee Chair: Myles Braithwaithe

== Bylaw Changes ==
 * There is a change to Not-for-profit legislation
 * 3 years to get our bylaws fixed
 * Bylaws available in electronic form here: https://github.com/gtalug/bylaws
 * There is an oddity in the revisions of November 2001 where board terms were defined to be 2 years, whereas a lot of things are considered to involve 1 year terms in the bylaws
 * Bill Thanis looking at revising bylaws
 * Worth contacting Evan L as he's involved with the same revisions for ISOC Canada

== Inventory of Social Networking Stuff ==
 * Myles suggest having a PR officer and a committee organized similarly to POG, though likely with only a couple meetings per year
 * To pursue after AGM and new board

== CAG ==
 * Not much lately
 * ISOC as leverage for LSUC/Bar Society
 * IETF pushed draft of info RFC to parent body
 * RFC on avoiding problems with filtering
 * Open Data
   * Suggested opening data to Rob Ford and Karen Stintz
   * The strategy is to sell the "line" that open data leads to saving money on IT

== Systems Stuff ==

 * Big Blue Button.  Still running
 * Rack cleanup
   * No real movement
 * Mailing list issues
   * Note there has been some griping surrounding the state of things; apparently DCB email does not make it to the public list.
   * Some noise about Majordomo1 being extremely obsolescent, some commendation of version 2...
   * Scott pursuing this
 * All up to Scott...
 * There was a bit of a server outage; fuse failure
   * Not too visible...

== "Soup" Planning ==

 * Myles constructed a list of nearby options; found here: https://gist.github.com/myles/6685789
 * People haven't all moved over to Spring Roll Go
 * Some still at Panera
 * Others doing... Other things...
 * Be it resolved...
   * No more "official soup"
   * Official removal of "reins" over where people are suggested to go
   * Stop spinning
   * URL to place reasonable to eat, e.g. - like Myles' list
   * If people want to coordinate to go somewhere, it's happy to send a note to GTALUG saying, "I wanna go to X; anyone else that wants to come can..."
