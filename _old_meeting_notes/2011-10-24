 * Quarterly mtg in Dakar
 * Complex issue
   * 3 types of tlds
     * GTLD
     * Special
     * Country Codes
       * Owned by ICANN, delegated
       * PR is for Puerto Rico, was run thru a University
       * Gauss Research Labs was founded, and sent a transfer letter to IANA who then delegated the zone
       * GRL shifted to private company, essentially absconded with ownership of all the names
       * Filtering thru criminal courts
       * Part of North America
       * We (NARELO) drafted a letter asking ICANN/IANA to explain their due diligence, or lack thereof
       * Redelegation to bring it back...
       * Apparently research indicates that this has happened before
         * .SU still exists despite there no longer being a Soviet Union
         * Apparently one that's an unpeopled island
         * Another one is a volcano
       * Important because some governments are considering pressuring for removal of ICANN/IANA and shifting this to ITU
     * New GTLD program of roughly mid-January
       * Little known
       * Some effort to explain this
       * Expecting some PR budget by end of October
         * Radio ads and bus signage likely relevant in regions where this is expected to be active
       * Expecting scams
         * Pre-registrations for TLDs that aren't nearly in existence yet
       * We may have opportunity to help educate on this
         * We might be able to help out with DNS comprehension
     * User survey coming out
       * Designed to give NARELO some idea of what to pick at next
       * We should try to go out to more public places via folks like David Patrick
     * In midst of more meetings, some politicking
       * GAC gripes; some EU folk think ICANN should be disbanded and given to EU
       * China + Russia imagining they can control ITU and that this should let them control ICANN's remains

== PAC ==
 * Need more active PAC members
 * Dave suffering from mild case of needing a positive decision maker
 * Looked for backup on location; if ever any issues, Sullivan possibilities
 * Dave going on volunteer staff with John Filion, councillor for around-here...
   * Looking for school age data entry assistance

== Conference Stuff ==
 * Publicity done for FSOSS
 * GTALUG is on the sponsored page, not segregated by sponsorship levels
 * Paperwork done
 * Off to get swag today
 * Need black tablecloth for table
 * GTALUG doesn't have group pictures at this point; often publicity = photography

== CIPS Stuff ==
 * Got $500
 * Need to use it...
 * Purpose...
   * Should we try to reach out beyond Toronto proper?
   * Not necessarily...
   * Lots of local organizations, but not really much connection, and some inconsistency
   * Compare to Bay Area user groups
   * Encourage effort surrounding Group of Groups
