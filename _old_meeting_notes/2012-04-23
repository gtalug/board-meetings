   * New GTLDs hit snag

== GTALUG Purpose ==
 * Original purpose was to educate folks
   * ICANN, POG are arguably a different direction
 * If education is a Core Value, that makes it clearer how we relate to things like Maureen's educational proposal
 * Yes, POG/ICANN are part of mandate, as long as our purpose is to educate our members and community
 * POG seems somewhat separate; advocacy seems secondary to education

== Education ==
 * More presented by Maureen...
