== ICANN Update ==

Myles' entire email (involving much effort) was accepted.  And XXX has been approved of sorts.  There are a number of further qualification steps needed by ICM; they need to go through some of the qualification process again.

Gord expressed frustrations to Evan, that we were wondering if we should be continuing efforts.  He offered to take letter on frustrations to ALAC.

Three top level IDN ccTLDs were approved...  

  * Taiwan
  * Hong Kong
  * China

DNSSEC deployed; signing of root July 15th.

Some time near 2012 is when IPv4 runs out of addresses.

WHOIS has gotten controversial again...  Several studies on WHOIS data.
  * According to studies, WHOIS is between 25-29% accurate; about 75% ''wrong''
  * Controversy: ICANN prone to study more...

A panel on DNS poisoning...  Apparently rather interesting...
   * Whitt/Diffie
   * Dan Kaminsky
   * Paul Makapetris
   * Others...

Hobbling towards new gTLDs...  The manual, "The Application Guide", is now in 4th draft.  If there is enough comment, then they will do a fifth draft.  No predictable date for launch.

== Upcoming Meeting Planning ==

  * Myles is still thinking about his July talk :-)
  * In fall, there are two on board to be potentially re-elected
     * Myles
     * David Patrick (who shouldn't be running)
  * Chris sent note to Toronto LISP folk about the "smackdown"

== OLGF ==

  * Richard approached Seneca, asking her about possible talks
  * Not pursuing further for now...
  * We don't imagine we actually want a booth...
  * If we have not been contacted by next meeting, we are not "boothing."

== PAC ==

  * Had a meeting
  * There were cookies
  * They will not eat cake
  * Want to encourage having expression for "ordinary members" as opposed to just corporate representation
  * Beyond GPL...  Possibly preferring Open Source Definition
  * Desire for conciliatory approach
  * Wanting to offer legislative advice
  * Government code should belong to the government...
  * Concerned about C-32, EU software warranty issues
  * Interesting area: 3D printers and such, on horizon.  Rather odd.

  * Be it resolved that Gord go to Ottawa to make friends with the government.  (On no money...)
    * Gord, Mike, Seneca, David pro
    * Myles con
