== PAC ==

 * David CB presented a spreadsheet of positions of the "big 3" parties
  * Unable to get much information out of parties
 * Green Party has a position on open source, being in support of it, keen on use of open standards, likelihood of electing an MP seems pretty low
 * Red points
   * All for a particular party
 * Green points
   * Only one for Conservatives: that they cut off UBB
 * Suggestion that the material be presented
 * Re-raise the sexual harassment policy in May, consider ratifying something based on Ubuntu policy

== ICANN ==
 * XXX was approved; some porn industry folk protested
 * Can pre-register names you desire, perhaps to suppress (e.g. - disney.xxx)
 * ICANN want to look important about IPv6

== Projecting ==
 * Looking good...
 * Suggest that Drew publishes specs

== Conference ==
 * ITEC was visited by Colin; apparently somewhat depressing

== Outreach ==
 * Issue noticed is that we don't have notably good place to post PAC material beyond the GTALUG mailing list
 * Thought: Encourage generating blog entries
 * Aggregator: "Planet GTALUG"?
 * There should be some regular-ish postings
   * Exec meeting notes
   * Thanking the last speaker
   * Announcing the next speaker
   * Upcoming events
 * Drew intends to get around to Mailman migration some time in near future
 * Should link the gtalug.org/cal into the front page
 * Ask other user groups if they have iCal files that we could link to, such as HackLab and such
   * Toronto user groups
 * Can someone grab a list of email addresses for DCB to send announcements to
