* If we are to build booth, that needs to be decided by Labour Day.  Gord needs to get pricing in by end of week...

==== Wiki Cards ====

One of those "neat ideas" would be to print up business cards with one
URL on them, namely something pointing to some central place on the
GTALUG wiki, say [[Resources]].

More message to this...  

* You are licensed, already.
* Have you Googled?

=== Wiki Matters ===

* Upgrading to a spam-freeable version of MediaWiki: when???

* Is there intent to do more to make the wiki suitable for general "linkability"?  I have done what I can, which is somewhat limited.

* Need to have a wiki page indicating [[Membership]] information, how to join, and such

* Bill to email Chris copy of Bylaws, and Constitution, that need to be posted.

=== Dichotomy ===
An observed dichotomy: Preference for LUG tends to fall on geographic lines, namely:

* Downtown folk prefer TLUG
* Outliers prefer NewTLUG or more regional ones

We need "more messages" on the GTALUG wiki, including this one...
