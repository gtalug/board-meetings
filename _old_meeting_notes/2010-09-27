=== AGM Matters ===
 * Chris to bring projector
 * Fabio ready, we trust?
 * Election Procedures
   * Ballots
   * Criteria
     * Willing to run
     * Member
     * No undischarged bankruptcy
     * Need a nominator
   * Scrutineers
   * Verification of membership

== Regular Business ==

   * Upcoming meetings
     * Up to February

== ICANN ==

   * The At Large Advisory committee divided across 5 geo regions
   * Has not had any voice on ICANN board
   * Each region needs to validate how they'll have votes for members for ICANN board
   * ICANN has two kinds of members
      * Organizations (like GTALUG)
      * Individuals
   * Just voted for individuals to vote for one board member; they are part of an implicit "org structure"
   * Organizational structures get a vote apiece
   * Gord intends to work with a working group to figure what kind of collaboration software ought to be used.

== PaC ==

  * Work by the political advocacy committee, what should / shouldn't be public? -- ''Colin''
  * Wiki set up to support the group
  * All seems like it is reasonable to have public.
  * On the other hand
    * Some strategy material might not be good to publish
    * Partially-thought-thru material perhaps shouldn't get published
    * Some people have dealings with the government and mightn't want private discussions dredged out
  * Colin will set up a private area

== Free Software Week ==

  * GTALug's response (if any) to Planet Geek and their plans for Free Software week. -- ''Colin''
  * Glad to send out an announcement or two

== Conference Running ==

Some back-of-envelope guesses...

  * OLGF had ~400 attendees
  * Implies about $16000 of attendee fees
  * Add in some amount of sponsorship
  * Guess: $25K-$30K overall receipts

  * Costs have been rather close to that, major components likely to include:
     * Venue rental
     * Water/Coffee service - generally must be bought thru venue
     * Travel costs for some speakers
     * A/V rental ?
     * Brochures

Observations on this:
   * Those funds are mostly committed before the conference
   * DebConf notes that government funding takes ~2yrs to arrive
   * Better venues might be MUCH pricier!
   * Need to have someone with at least $20K to "invest"

Gord & Scott will discuss this further and come back with results.

== New Business ==
  * Should solicit KWLUG to cross-pollinate speakers
  * Projector
    * To research further over the next few months
    * Belongs to GTALUG
    * Not to be lent out
  * Announcements
