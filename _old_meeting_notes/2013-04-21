 * Big Blue Button
  * Got it working somewhere - VM's
  * Needs some nonGTALUG servers
  * VM on scott's server, partly done
  * IP addresses are now in place
 * mailing list work
  * Conclusion from managing other lists using Mailman is that it doesn't cope with spam nearly well enough
  * DMail was mentioned as possible alternative; see [http://netwinsite.com/download.htm]
  * Seems to Chris that there are several problems here, and that they don't necessarily imply a single tool
    * Managing list of subscribers, and sending all approved messages to them
    * Gatekeeper that determines which messages that come in should be approved to go to the list of subscribers

=== Inventory of Social Networking Stuff ===

In view of the change of location, we need to know what are all of the places where we publicize ourselves, such as Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and more.

Exec folk, please consult [http://gtalug.org/wiki/Social_Network_Groups Social Network Groups wiki page], and:
  * See if the list is complete; add entries as needful
  * Indicate where you have expertise (even if limited)

It would likely be worth adding to the inventory additional places where GTALUG is mentioned, particularly where it has date/location information that will have a habit of getting out of date.

== POG ==
 * Tightening up, seeking to follow successful ventures
 * cat herding hasn't been terribly successful
 * shift to professional skill development

=== ISOC ===

 * ISOC Canada exists now
 * No intent to have an organizational membership as that's rather expensive
 * Need to wait until the interim executive is replaced by an operational one

 * ICANN in Bejing just finished
 * Registry agreement draft left people seeming happy
 * Amendment saying board could amend anything was changed into an amending formula
 * Lotta WHOIS policy issues on privacy and such 
 * New GTLD space introduces new man-in-the-middle attacks
 * Not much interesting with NARELO
 * New CEO is pretty sales-oriented
 * New ICANN offices with fair bit of autonomic power in diverse locations
