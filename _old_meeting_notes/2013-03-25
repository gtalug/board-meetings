Evan is keen on making ISOC Canada into something
 * Joy and happiness in joining ISOC as individuals
 * Organizational memberships are more costly, quite likely not worth much to us just now
 * Some people that were not aware that they might have been interested have evidently become members of ISOC

 * Regional meetings
 * Visit icann.org, look for Bejing schedule
 * ITU had attempts to control Internet and mobile stuff; both proved troublesome

(1) - Using one of the classrooms: All classes are equipped with
presentation technology. The Dept is not in charge of the classrooms
therefore the booking needs to be done prior to each event. The Dept can
do this for GTALUG. The room may change from one meeting to the other
pending the schedule and availability of the room.

(2) - Using one of the Computer Science Labs: All labs are equipped with
smart boards and white boards. The Dept is in charge of the labs and
once the meeting location is decided upon it remains the same for at
least 4 months (semester). The labs, however, can seat 36 people. Extra
chairs maybe provided to accommodate more attendees.

#2 was considered preferred, for now.  A site visit is planned in the coming week to make sure there is nothing terrifyingly wrong about that choice; DCB collected a list of logistical issues to watch for.
