** Items

*** Next board meeting

 - Let's do a survey as to what is preferred timing for board meeting, with new executive
 - Is there an issue that board meeting has gotten less social?  Hence less desirable to attend?
 - We aren't good about publicizing where and when the meeting is
 - Meeting is no longer at someone's house, hence is a bit more inherently open to public
 - Maybe we should be sending invitations to the "regular" list?
 - Possibly we could use the room at Ryerson on a different Tuesday, or use it for something else
 - Here seems to be fine

*** Upcoming Meetings
 - November :: Announce new executive
   - Bit of report on things for the past year
   - Doing some lightning talks
 - December :: vmFarms?  Earthquakes and NTP?
 - January :: Giles Orr
 - Speaker coordination
   - should be about contacting speakers
   - directions
   - parking, dining, logistics
   - someone to contact regarding help
   - Addresses
     - email address speaker-coordinator@gtalug.org
     - email address speakers@gtalug.org
     - Currently forwarding to Myles

**** Ideas
 - Idea that came up: tmux versus screen
 - SystemD
   - KWLUG had a talk not long ago, perhaps could draw someone in
   - Special Code of Conduct for such a talk

     - The speaker was there to explain
   - Was a short talk at KWLUG, on how to replace cron jobs using SystemD
