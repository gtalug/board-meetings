   - Bit of report on things for the past year
   - nothing worth mentioning yet

   - directions
   - parking, dining, logistics
   - someone to contact regarding help
**** Ideas
 - Idea that came up: tmux versus screen
 - Alex to poke RPi guy
 - SystemD
   - KWLUG had a talk not long ago, perhaps could draw someone in
   - Special Code of Conduct for such a talk
     - /No explaining from the crowd/
     - The speaker was there to explain
   - Was a short talk at KWLUG, on how to replace cron jobs using SystemD

*** ICANN
 - Gord provided report
*** Engagement with Ryerson
 - Gord needs to free up some time
 - Myles would like to know who we contact about rooms
*** Infrastructure
**** Backups
 - Survey engine uses MySQL, also GNU Social
 - ought to have a backup of that
 - Alex would like to have a "deploy" user, good idea

**** MediaWiki
- Bill has gotten some stuff up
- Myles would like to get database up and running
- Can mount it, can't launch it as a VM
- Went thru RHAT pvm translation to make kvm target
**** TRAC
- Myles has tooling to pull stuff out of TRAC if it ever comes up again
*** AGM
 - Chris to talk financey
 - Scott to talk presidential
** Action Items
 - TODO - Bill :: Electoral stuff
   - Forms
   - Be broadly ready
 - TODO - After AGM
   - Let's do a survey as to what is preferred timing for board meeting, with new executive
   - Is there an issue that board meeting has gotten less social?
   - We aren't good about publicizing where and when the meeting is
   - Meeting is no longer at someone's house, hence is a bit more inherently open to public
   - Maybe we should be sending invitations to the "regular" list?
   - Possibly we could use the room at Ryerson on a different Tuesday
 - TODO - Myles :: AWOL speaker
 - TODO - Gord :: Provide Ryerson contact info
 - TODO - Myles :: backup handling for MySQL
   - propose a way of having several copies distributed of MySQL data
 - TODO - Bill :: Bylaws???
