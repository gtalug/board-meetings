* Why gtalug.info?

  Set up by Chris... We knew we were planning to do some "surgery" on
  gtalug.org, and wanted to have a sort of "scratch domain" to use to
  get a dry run that looked realistic.  (Notably, we wanted to shift
  registrars, and there's enough in the process that there was a
  certain amount of risk of outage that we wanted to avoid...)

  Hence, I registered gtalug.info, and we made sure it was there and
  in good order before repeating processes on gtalug.org.

  If there is a desire to mess around with a domain, gtalug.info is
  perfectly good for that purpose.  We've had it resolving similarly
  to gtalug.org, but that shouldn't be depended on, and there's merit
  to having it attached to something that looks all
  "under-construction-y" so people don't trust it to be front-line
  ops.
