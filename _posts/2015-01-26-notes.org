*** Last Month
- January :: Mike Hoye - Mozilla community manager, on FSOSS material on social engineering, building community on purpose, bugzilla, getting contributors

**** Successes
- Broadly enjoyed
- He thought it went well

**** Failures
- Needed a bit more moderation, a bit too many questions
     
*** Upcoming

- February :: Looking at Q&A
- March :: Sergio - LibrePlanet, GDB, something...

**** No Dates

- Panel on Productivity Software :: ToDo.sh, TaskWarrior
- Chris Tyler, Open Source Lab :: Some project will be out of NDA in July, worth soliciting
- Gord :: Marketing Peoples' Selves

*** Roles at GTALUG
 - Need a set of "buck stops here" roles
   - System Administration :: Myles with Mike Kalles as fallback
   - Speaker Coordination :: Scott
   - CAG :: Chair is Mike Kalles
   - Legalities :: Scott, Chris
   - Engagement with Ryerson :: Gord and DCB
     - At adminstration level
       - Perfect subject to discuss is how to document accessibility
     - At student body level
       - We'd be seen as useful if we can help with careers

** Attendances and Diversity
  - Interesting discussion to this end at the previous meeting
  - When meetings have attracted diverse crowds, that has resulted
    from curiously diverse topics
    - Notable example was the talk on computer graphics
    - Specific topic that was somewhat outside our domain
  - We /do/ have the Code of Conduct that was prominent at Hoye's talk

** Mailing List

*** Action Items From Last Month

  - New :: Should we be blocking HTML-based email?
  - We can, in principle
  - Many modern mail clients send both HTML and plain text
    - If we block HTML, that injures those clients
  - Risk of us blocking people we shouldn't
  - Philosophical matter...  Don't want to answer it just now.
  - Membership straw poll generally agreed that HTML now "is what it is"
    - Why this argument in 2014?

*** Moderators
  - Moderator overseeing things
    - Only Myles at this point
    - Alex thought he volunteered
    - Bill is moderating somewhat
  - Apparently things are done...

** CAG & ICANN
- Report came in...  Thank you, Gord!!!
- Suggestion that the report be sent in PDF
- A Question...
  - There is an ambition by Certain Folk to have a North American General Assembly some time in the next year
  - To get all of the organizations like us in NARALO together to chat on outreach
  - Are we interested in participating in this meeting?
  - Gord suggests "yes", on a moderate level of interest
  - Want to have non-GTALUG material removed from GTALUG page at ICANN
  - If they're going to pay for people to go to Montreal or such, then fine...

** Projects for a bit later
  - Get LITP a bit earlier, probably April as when to start thinking

** Test Backups
  - Point Alex at the backups Git repo, which provides a fair bit of
    census info as to what stuff we have running

** Why gtalug.info?

  Set up by Chris... We knew we were planning to do some "surgery" on
  gtalug.org, and wanted to have a sort of "scratch domain" to use to
  get a dry run that looked realistic.  (Notably, we wanted to shift
  registrars, and there's enough in the process that there was a
  certain amount of risk of outage that we wanted to avoid...)

  Hence, I registered gtalug.info, and we made sure it was there and
  in good order before repeating processes on gtalug.org.

  If there is a desire to mess around with a domain, gtalug.info is
  perfectly good for that purpose.  We've had it resolving similarly
  to gtalug.org, but that shouldn't be depended on, and there's merit
  to having it attached to something that looks all
  "under-construction-y" so people don't trust it to be front-line
  ops.
