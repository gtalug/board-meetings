*** Touch on where and when this meeting happens next

  Hacklab seems fine...  July 27th, 7:30pm
  Some parking at the back, behind a Hacklab member.

*** Linux in the Park 2015
 - It happened
 - Decent dose of people
 - Trello-based menu of preparations
   - Some slight controversy on this; some people weren't keen on running the "join Trello" gauntlet to add items in
   - Boy, it would be nice to have a wiki around for this...
 - At Dufferin Grove, July 25th
 - Bill to watch out for BBQ in case Drew isn't bringing it

*** Code of Conduct
   - No new news, have pretty well saturated membership with mention of where to find out about it
   - We should try at meetings to spread out (as leaders) and not go to the same area of the room consistently

** Action Items
- TODO - Chris :: Ask on Ops list if there is a more preferred location for Ops meetings as attendance has been a bit sketchy
- TODO - Myles :: To contact guy on Open Municipal Data
- TODO - Scott :: Talk with Giles Orr about a talk, perhaps "State of the Window Manager 2015"
  - Myles suggests Giles on Ansible?
- TODO - Alex :: More attempts to restore from backup
- TODO - Myles :: I2P conference speakers, darknetj?
