**** How is testing the backups going.
  
**** Getting evote installed
  [[https://github.com/mdipierro/evote][Evote]]
  Myles has looked at it, referenced from Mike Fletcher
  - Used for board votes
  - Had to check with lawyers that it's legally valid
  - Anyone can set up a vote after having been set up to be able to vote
  - Invite only
  - Sadly no survey features, which is kind of the most attractive thing
  - Myles will set up a dinner survey using it
  - Myles has responsibility for setting it up, making sure that it's able to be readily backed up and restored

*** Engagement with Ryerson
- Get an ongoing dialog going
- Getting an auditorium instead of a lab.
- Gord got things started, will hopefully pursue DCB and chat with Ryerson folk in another couple weeks

*** Linux in the Park 2015
  - About now is the time to figure out when we'd like to do it
  - Idea of heading to the Island?
    - Sadly, logistics are worse, no parking
    - Likely logistics are even worse due to PanAm games goings on
  - Should try to avoid PanAm games timing - July 10-26
  - Also try to avoid ParaPan games Aug 7-15
  - Dufferin Park may be fine during that timeframe
  - Suggested: July 18, July 25th, Aug 1 (which is in the long weekend), Aug 8
  - Logistics of things to bring, we already have material to copy from last year
  
*** Code of Conduct
 - Haven't mentioned on the mailing list that CoC applies
 - Should notify on that
 - No rush; do this when Mike has an update ready to CoC

** Action Items
  - TODO - Myles - contact David about timekeeping, is that better for June or July or what?  DCB had some contact at York on this.   Look for someone that knows about how to handle NTP in VM context
  - TODO - Alex - Talk with Chris Tyler, Open Source Labs, hoping for August or so
  - TODO - Gord - start poking at a "Marketing Ourselves" talk
    - It'll be a wee while
    - People should pester Gord on this
  - TODO - Chris - pester William Murrithy about SAMBA talk
