  Myles has looked at it, referenced from Mike Fletcher
  - Used for board votes
  - Had to check with lawyers that it's legally valid
  - Anyone can set up a vote after having been set up to be able to vote
  - Invite only
  - Sadly no survey features, which is kind of the most attractive thing
  - Myles will set up a dinner survey using it
  - Myles has responsibility for setting it up, making sure that it's able to be readily backed up and restored
