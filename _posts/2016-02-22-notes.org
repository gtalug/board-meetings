**** Ideas
 - Stewart on imaging/paperless using Linux
   - Consider this as either a "major" topic for around November
   - Alternatively as a backup topic
 - SystemD
 - CHIP guy on $9 computer
   - Myles has pursued this; might look to engage with Ryerson at some other time
 - Municipal Data
   - They're up to something new, and want to wait
 - Chris should prep a "new in Postgres" talk
 - Inkscape
 - Open Graphics panel
   - GiMP and Inkscape - Trent
   - SVG file manipulation - Myles
   - Inkscape patterns - Stewart

*** ICANN

  - Gord presented notes...

  - More to say in a couple weeks

  - Gord would like someone (chair?) to comment on the next time there is a motion approving new organizations
    - Suggest that if there are things that come up, present it to the Ops mailing list for consensus response

*** Engagement with Ryerson
  - No movement
  - Need to ping Scott on this

*** Infrastructure
**** Backups
 - Some discussion on requirements has taken place
 - Fewer backups taking place just now...
 - Myles looking at using Ansible to deploy things
**** MediaWiki
  - Bill got the filesystem mounted and copied
  - About 1GB of data
  - Need the MySQL dump to load into a new instance???  But this seems extremely troublesome.
  - Suggest looking for a "redhat" or "LSB" or "version" file in /etc
  - Yum repo likely has version number captured somewhere
  - Seems like what we'd most like to get out of this are the attachments, which might be in files, or in a MySQL table (hope not)

**** TRAC
  - Myles has tooling to pull stuff out of TRAC if it ever comes up again
*** Mailing List Rules
  - Myles put some material together
  - Stewart added CoC comments
  - Scott rewrote it to be more positively-spun
  - What next?
    - Publish the new rule set on the mailing list?
    - Proposal
      - Myles to discuss
        - We simplified the language
        - We clarified some rules surrounding job postings
*** Linux in the Park
  - Location - Dufferin Grove Park has been fine
  - June is the preliminary thought for timing
  - Saturday afternoon seems to work fine
  - No long weekends to steer clear of in June
  - Let's present the possible dates along with major regional events at the April meeting
  - Idea to hold it twice, with a somewhere else involved
** Action Items
  - Chris TODO :: See if we need to file something about bylaw update, do so, if need be.
  - Gord TODO :: Get contact emails for Ryerson folk from Scott
  - To Do in April :: Discuss linode as we may need to migrate due to $CDN weakness
  - Myles TODO :: Get list of regional events for next board meeting, so we can present at April meeting
