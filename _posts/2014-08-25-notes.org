** Mailing List

*** Action Items From Last Month

- Scott :: Warn people that mailing list might die somewhat randomly; look at gtalug.org if it seems dead for pointer
- Myles :: Set up Linode VPS, mailman
- Chris :: Backup strategies; copy to Git, encrypt if needed
  - [[https://github.com/cbbrowne/slony-backups/blob/master/scripts/Slony-Archive-Mail.sh][Script to archive Mailman archives]]
  - [[https://github.com/cbbrowne/slony-backups/blob/master/scripts/Slony-Archive-Mail-Subscribers.sh][Sample Script to encrypt email address list]]
  - Chris has a script he regularly uses called ~gitcfroot~ that pulls
    a variety of things into a git repo for backup, specifically:
    - CFEngine Scripts
    - BIND files
    - DHCP files
    - The approach is easily extensible to more; the /real issue/ will
      be to identify what we want backed up
      - Each service we add should indicate something to be backed up
    - The big *problem area* is of when to worry about there being
      material that should be encrypted before backup so that it is
      not seen by the wrong prying eyes

*** Myles' Plan

- Rent the cheapest VPS at Linode ($10 a month). Which will be called ~penguine~.
- Setup mailman on ~penguine~.
- The President to send out an email explaining what is going on.
- Contacting the top contributors (people who produce content) to the mailing list and ask them to help test.
- If testing goes according to plan ask everyone to resubscribe.
