** Meetings

*** Action Items From Last Month
- Myles :: To retrieve old wiki web page on meeting logistics, add to web site with addition on mobile hotspots
- Chris :: To check on miking speakers
  - Some searching done...
    - We could get a PA system; probably costs around $200 for
      something we'd want to use, which is pretty expensive for
      something we've only once gotten the impression someone maybe
      wanted.
    - The entertaining construction is of Bluetooth headset pointing
      to phone/tablet pointing to Bluetooth speaker.  Not sure that'll
      actually work out well; I expect it to be pretty laggy.
    - Not sure this is worth doing.
