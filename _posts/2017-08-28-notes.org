  - Scott Sullivan (board member)
  - Stewart Russell (board member)
  - Gordon Chillcott
  - Christopher Browne (board member)

** Topics

*** Meetup.com

- SR isn't in favour of doing meetup.com
  - good for managing the meeting
  - issues with admin spamming
  - good for SEO but way to much interest with little attendence
- consensus is it's a neat idea but not worth the money spent
- needs to be in the realm of regular activity

*** Upcoming Meetings
 - Next quarter is planned
 - Some meta discussions about video
   - Would be nice for it to be more publicized
 - Recent Tor talk
   - went pretty well; another presentation of it that was short on time went much less well
 - Talks on video
   - Several available now...
   - Scott looked for a would-be vanity YouTube URL, got random # one instead

*** ICANN
 - Gord presented notes
 - 

*** New Graphics for Logo
 - Should be somewhat GTA-centric
 - Avoid things in other groups' designs
 - A custom penguin would be nice
 - Pixel Art is desirable
 - Nice to have it nice as roughly circular/square, at 5cm diameter
   - Circle or square, they're way cheaper
 - Limited color choices
   - Look to what Mozilla did with their logo contest
 - Pay rate of $300 for the design
 - Be It Resolved that we budget $300 for production of a logo
   - 3 in favor
   - 1 abstained with cause
 - Had previously thrown the matter out to the broader list looking for volunteers without result

** Action Items
 - LITP announcement
 - Arrange a cheque for Alex - Scott will introduce Chris to Alex Hess
 - Chris to put together the membership form baggie for August meeting
 - Scott to poke at Graphix work with Trent, aiming at end of August availability
 - Start process of determining who's up to what vis-a-vis Myles' activity list
   - System management
   - Mailing list management
   - Speaker management
   - Web site updates
 - Myles to switch web site to Jekyll
 - Everyone try to install Jekyll

*** Upcoming Meetings

*** ICANN material from Gord
 - Atlas 3 is still up in the air, timing and location
 - WHOIS changes bit back due to EU data protection legislation
   - GNSO was wondering to do or not
   - EU seem to have pressed the matter
   - Plans are somewhat under way
 - At Large review commentary seems... fraught...

*** Going over Myles' list of tasks

- <https://wiki.gtalug.org/user:myles:tasks>

- Pushing out meeting notes
  - Inside git repo, do git pull to get latest web site
  - Then, fab deploy, using a package called "fabric" and python-yaml
    - This uses rsync to push data over to gtalug.org
    - configuration is in fabfile.py, which is at top level of the board meetings

*** Preparation for AGM
 - Three board seats open
   - Myles, Stewart, Scott
 - Should target several people to run
 - Treasurer update by Chris
 - Prez Report by Scott
 - Returning Officer: bit of TBD, thinking about Bill and Gord

*** Approval of logo
 - Discussion of feedback with Trent
 - Pretty much as-is works well
 - Motion to approve the expenditure
   - Unanimous approval with one abstention
*** Write next month's agenda.
