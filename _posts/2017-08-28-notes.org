** Topics

*** Meetup.com

- SR isn't in favour of doing meetup.com
  - good for managing the meeting
  - issues with admin spamming
  - good for SEO but way to much interest with little attendence
- consensus is it's a neat idea but not worth the money spent
- needs to be in the realm of regular activity

*** Upcoming Meetings
 - Next quarter is planned
 - Some meta discussions about video
   - Would be nice for it to be more publicized
*** Linux in the Park (22 July @ 2pm)
 - Aftermath
 - Location well liked
 - Decent turnout including some new people given cloudy weather
 - Should have publicized more heavily at the start of June
 - Better BBQ hardware was way better
 - Can have a wider diversity of Tasty Beverages in private space
*** ICANN
 - Gord presented notes
 - Atlas 2 coming soon
 - WHOIS data undergoing active work, spurred by EU privacy legislation
 - At large review
 - NARALO - selecting a delegate for Abu Dabi meeting

*** New Graphics for Logo
 - Should be somewhat GTA-centric
 - Avoid things in other groups' designs
 - A custom penguin would be nice
 - Pixel Art is desirable
 - Nice to have it nice as roughly circular/square, at 5cm diameter
   - Circle or square, they're way cheaper
 - Limited color choices
   - Look to what Mozilla did with their logo contest
 - Pay rate of $300 for the design
 - Be It Resolved that we budget $300 for production of a logo
   - 3 in favor
   - 1 abstained with cause
 - Had previously thrown the matter out to the broader list looking for volunteers without result
