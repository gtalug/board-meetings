** CAG/ICANN
   - ICANN presently in London, England
   - The board would like for Scott to bring back a report/debrief for CAG and/or Board for next month
     - Nice idea is to debrief CAG and figure out what is worth bringing to Board
     - This would be really good material for presenting at the AGM in the fall
     - It points out that we're doing things
     - Nice if there's even some visibility to ICANN of the resulting material
   - IANA thing that Bill volunteered for will start in July

    1GB/traffic per month per Myles
