  - Where do we edit things?  How do we make sure we get it right?

  - Let us now treat GitHub as "legacy"
    - Put something on Home pages of each repo to indicate that
    - Also, mark the repositories as "archive"

    - One for web site repo
    - Mr Meesses to generate email notices

**** Ryerson LUG
  - A LUG has emerged
  - They have asked Evan to speak, which is a fine idea
  - Scott would like to see if there is a coherent conversation to be had
  - Scott would like to do coherent updates to our list of Other Groups
  - If we can offer help, that would be nice

**** Toronto PostgreSQL Users Group
  - Also, need to add this
  - Dave is looking for 2 month cadence on meetings

*** FSOSS
  - Do we want to make a presence there?
  - Ask if folks are interested in going as GTALUG branded speakers?
     (Slide Decks, T-Shirts, cards?)

*** Advertising
  - Physical Posters, on ryerson campus?
  - We are an official organization as far as Ryerson is concerned
  - Check with Ryerson LUG to see if their channels are of use
  - See if there is anything we may do to help

*** Social Media Presence
