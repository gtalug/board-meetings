*** ICANN material from Gord
  - Not much going on
  - Notable thing being the policy development on registrant data release has stopped
    - Chair resigned/retired (Chuck Holmes)
  - Group reviewing the things surrounding breakup of ICANN from US Federal Government
  - Technical Issues Group, does not have meetings, just mailing list activity when things happen
  - Candidates presentation meeting May 14/15 as North American At Large elections are coming up
  - Evan's observation on committee on what to do with auction proceeds
    - In a private auction, money goes to the losers, and "everyone is happy"
    - In ICANN auction, ICANN winds up with a (pretty big) pot of money
      - But then has painful fighting over what to do with the money
      - ICANN apparently has a cash crunch; can they use the money?
      - Lots of painful mess on this...
    - Watch for Jonathan Zuch (?), in NARALO, possible electoral candidate

*** Video matters
 - Need intro screen so that we have a "punchy" beginning
 - Need an "Intro to GTALUG" video, nice to have as a revision to the ICANN video

*** Transfer Penguin Linode to GTALUG

*** Notes about zoom based meeting
 - The ID was one set up by Evan
 - If this works, we'll want to set up our own zoon ID
 
*** Write next month's agenda
 - Location
