** Mailing list issues
  Wording (from code of conduct) that would be very good to add to the
  messaging...

  "We assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathetic
  fashion." and "we seek to teach people how to improve themselves
  rather than to quickly exclude them for their misunderstandings or
  mistakes."

  - Musing on what to do about this...
    - Agreement is to moderate him for three months
    - Should let R know which message led to the concern
    - With some revised wording
    - Response to G...
      - We have considered the matter
      - We appreciate your comments
      - We have decided to hold his messages for moderation for a period of time
  
  - Future policy
    - If moderation gets applied, then please be sure to forward email to the Board

** Mailing list 2
  Hugh had some comments

  - March 14th, a tome on how Mailman is remapping data into Base64
  - It's because of a Mailman/Python thing
  - We could remedy it via removing the message footer
  - Largely because of Yahoo and Outlook
  - Mailman 3 remedies some Yahoo/Outlook issues
  - But Mailman 3 isn't integrated by any of the major distributions

** Action Items
  - TODO - Myles to do moderation change
  - TODO - In June, turn off moderation
