*** Infrastructure

**** How is testing the backups going.
  Some ongoing discussions taking place
  Alex is not getting the subscriber list piece working, that's all that isn't working
  Chris needs to further document it better
  
**** Getting evote installed
  [[https://github.com/mdipierro/evote][Evote]]
  Myles has looked at it, referenced from Mike Fletcher
  - Used for board votes
  - Had to check with lawyers that it's legally valid
  - Anyone can set up a vote after having been set up to be able to vote
  - Invite only
  - Sadly no survey features, which is kind of the most attractive thing
  - Myles will set up a dinner survey using it
  - Myles has responsibility for setting it up, making sure that it's able to be readily backed up and restored

**** Setting up Chef/Puppet/Ansible/Salt on the current server.
  Do we want this?
   - Maybe wanna set up Chef/Puppet/Ansible to set up our services
   - Straw poll shows nobody is particularly intimate with any of these
   - There's some learning curve
   - Argue for "no" for now

*** Engagement with Ryerson

**** Getting an auditorium instead of a lab. 

*** Linux in the Park 2015

  - About now is the time to figure out when we'd like to do it

*** Code of Conduct

**** Mailing List
