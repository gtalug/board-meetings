** Infrastucture
*** Linode migration
  - Somewhat good idea to shift to Digital Ocean, it being local and cheaper
  - Decision point: April
  - Overlap should take place May/June
  - Closing down linode in July...
  - Linode has a cheaper node which we might be able to find suitable
    - Alex noted this at February meeting
    - This cheaper plan is still there...
    - Probably need to establish a new node, and migrate services over to it...
  - Need to start the migration June 13th
