*** Linux in the Park 2015
 - It's happening
 - Bunch of people interested in coming
 - Trello-based menu of preparations
 - At Dufferin Grove, July 25th
 - Bill to watch out for BBQ in case Drew isn't bringing it

*** Code of Conduct
 - Mike has made some changes to the code
 - Myles encouraging him to commit them to main repo, which has been done
 - Minor changes
   - Revised accessibility a bit
   - Better language on what is and is not allowed
   - Make it clearer that this is not about "zero tolerance"
 - Myles' issue...
   - How does it address interpersonal relationships?
     - Someone feels slighted by others.
   - If the problem related to club-related matters, we need to be able to have a conversation.
   - The code is oriented to handling one person wronging another, and addressing that.
   - It is not well oriented to matters that aren't clearly something of one person disliking another.
   - We should try at meetings to spread out (as leaders) and not go to the same area of the room consistently

** Action Items
  - TODO - Bill, to get Mike ssh access to the mediawiki (& stuff) volume
  - TODO - Bill, to see if Drew's coming to LITP with BBQ
  - TODO - All, to pick seats in meeting more at random
