  - YouTube
    - Should we turn on comments?
    - No.  Myles has seen Python related things become cesspools

*** YouTube thumbnail template
  - Your custom thumbnail image should be as large as possible, as the image will also be used as the preview image in the embedded player. We recommend your custom thumbnails:
  - Have a resolution of 1280x720 (with minimum width of 640 pixels).
  - Be uploaded in image formats such as .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG. 
  - Remain under the 2MB limit. 
  - Try to use a 16:9 aspect ratio as it's the most used in YouTube players and previews.

 - enabled for gtalug.info
 - should we enable for gtalug.org?
 - management considerations
*** Write next month's agenda
