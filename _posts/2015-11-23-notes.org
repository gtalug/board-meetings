*** Next board meeting

*** Upcoming Meetings
 - December :: vmFarms?  Earthquakes and NTP?
 - January :: Giles Orr
 - Speaker coordination
   - should be about contacting speakers
   - directions

**** Ideas
 - Idea that came up: tmux versus screen
 - Alex to poke RPi guy
 - SystemD
   - KWLUG had a talk not long ago, perhaps could draw someone in
