   - Short topics
   - Feedback was that people enjoyed it
   - They liked the style
   - Should have been more forceful on the rules, perhaps
   - Stewart and Alex should have gone much earlier, that would have seeded thoughts, ideas, willingness, maybe
   - Announce earlier

   - Backup strategy :: Scott on PXE in 2015, Chris on Screen + tmux
 - January :: Giles Orr - on VIM

   - someone to contact regarding help
   - Addresses
     - email address speaker-coordinator@gtalug.org

**** Ideas
 - Idea that came up: tmux versus screen
 - Myles would like to solicit an Ansible talk
   - David Thornton?
 - SystemD
   - KWLUG had a talk not long ago, perhaps could draw someone in
   - Special Code of Conduct for such a talk
     - /No explaining from the crowd/
     - The speaker was there to explain
   - Was a short talk at KWLUG, on how to replace cron jobs using SystemD
 - PyLadies :: Developers in newsrooms
 - CHIP guy on $9 computer
   - Myles has pursued this; might look to engage with Ryerson at some other time
 - Municipal Data
 - Entrepreneurship panel
   - Mike Hoye
   - 360, Blaze
   - Madison Kelly

*** ICANN
 - Gord provided report
 - Please look at [[http://newatlarge.icann.org/][new ICANN at large site]] and report comments to Gord
*** Engagement with Ryerson
 - Still under way
*** Infrastructure
**** Backups
 - Survey engine uses MySQL, also GNU Social https://github.com/gtalug/infrastructure/issues/41
 - ought to have a backup of that
 - Alex would like to have a "deploy" user, good idea
 - Some discussion on requirements has taken place, but answer never arrived
 - DCB had some good suggestions; need to do some implementation

**** MediaWiki
  - Copy of most material pulled from web.archive.org
  - Add ticket indicating that this has been pulled
  - Scott would like to retry pulling from Mediawiki

**** TRAC
  - Myles has tooling to pull stuff out of TRAC if it ever comes up again

**** Mailing lists
  - Myles would like to operate announce list for Homebrew Hosting Club
  - Just announcements, just quarterly
  - No discussion list
  - Overlap with GTALUG is 100%
  - It is more a SIG than a separate group

*** AGM Followup
  - Chair of Board :: Has been Mike Kalles
  - Mike thinks he may not be around enough
  - Defer to January

*** Financial Stuff
  - Need to get ID switched; only Drew is really known by the bank
  - Should get Scott and Chris set up as signing officers
  - Motion made, unanimously in favour

*** Announcements by Mr M...
  - Meeting announcements should be 36 hours in advance

** Action Items

  - Gord TODO :: Letter to new minister of Science, Innovation and several other things
  - Gord TODO :: Still poking at Ryerson contacts
    - Accessibility map seems insufficient
  - Hector TODO :: May have a contact at Ryerson that could help
  - Motion TODO :: Deferred Chair of Board vote to November
