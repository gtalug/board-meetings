**** Successes

**** Failures

*** Engagement with Ryerson
- Planning meeting took place
  - Scott, DCB, Gord
  - Going to propose a panel talk on getting hired that should be
    interesting to attract Ryerson students
  - Myles isn't sure this will necessarily be hugely interesting to
    students; there are already a lot of job fairs
  - Discussion to continue
  - Nice to have this as a report to the board much like CAG/ICANN
     
*** Upcoming

- April 14 :: Myles on LessCSS, Q&A
  - Questions WE want asked...
    - Is there a decent OSS survey and/or voting platform?

** Mailing list
  - Issue with rambling
  - Engagement seemed to work
    - DCB had weighed in, emailing the individual
    - We moderated the individual for a while, where someone had to approve posts
    - Still a bit rambly, but we can live with it...
    	  
** Attendances and Diversity
 - Myles would like to run surveys on what people like about GTALUG
 - Is there an open source survey platform?  That isn't too rocket-sciencey?
 - Ask in Q&A session

** Infrastructure
 - Someone disliked entering password for Mailman on a non-HTTPS connection
 - Do we care about a non-signed SSL?
 - Cloudflare might be a solution, but wants all DNS to pass thru them, not acceptable
 - StartSSL gives out a free SSL cert, but apparently the process is a bit convoluted
 - Mozilla LetsEncrypt.org, intended to be free, open, in relevant ways, later in 2015

*** Need for a "chat" service
 - Want to have ability to chat
 - And some people want to be on other than Google
   - IRC channel somewhere
 - The *REAL* solution is to have a cron job that sends out warning a week before the Ops meeting about the upcoming meeting

** CAG & ICANN

 - Report?  May come in from Gord separately

** Code of Conduct
 - We passed the Code in about February 2014
 - Perhaps tell members that the code is now a year down the road?
 - Some concerns have been raised
   - Minimal impact on organization
     - Member thought we had headed back to where we were
     - Supposedly returned to sexually charged matters?
     - Little agreement on that
   - Argument that the code is discriminatory
     - That code prevents some from expressing themselves freely
     - Strawman arguments abound...
   - How meetings are being chaired
     - Claim that some of the moderation is pretty pointed
     - Board thinks that seems OK thus far
     - Can we have a co-moderator?  That might improve biases
** Projects for a bit later
  - Get LITP a bit earlier, probably April as when to start thinking

** Test Backups
  - Point Alex at the backups Git repo, which provides a fair bit of
    census info as to what stuff we have running

** Action Items
  - Next Meeting - April 28th 7:30pm, where? Hacklab?
    - Hacklab seems fine
    - If we stay at Hacklab, should formalize some kind of contribution to Hacklab
  - TODO :: Next month Alex wants us to discuss getting an auditorium or such
  - TODO :: Next month discuss engagement with Ryerson
    - Includes getting floor plan
  - TODO :: Next month begin LITP planning
  - TODO Scott :: Scott needs to get drive to Bill with Mediawiki data, put this in the carry bag?
  - TODO Scott :: Digitize all of the GTALUG legal documents
  - TODO Alex :: Link main site to Archives of mailing list
    - Maybe ask Drew Sullivan about earlier mail archives
  - TODO Chris :: Sacha Chua for talk, perhaps
  - TODO Alex & Amos :: Test backups.
  - TODO Myles :: Check linode; do we want to renew contract?  Worry in a few months, current expires in August, so start worrying in June
  - TODO Myles :: Time Keeping Panel
    - ptp, what's up with NTP, other NTP implementations
    - Hardware implementations - GPS
    - What to do about VMs?
  - TODO Myles :: Will make sure some questions get asked on GTALUG behalf at Q&A
  - TODO ??? :: When Mozilla LetsEncrypt.org appears, we may want to set up SSL cert for our web site
