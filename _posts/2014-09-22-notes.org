** Meetings
 - TODO Mike :: Make a wee map of the floor plan
   - Got a somewhat ugly one
   - Doesn't seem to be a good diagram available from Ryerson
   - Mike will see about a Mark II version
 - New TODO :: Discuss projector
   - Rental of Drew's projector has term complete
   - It seems likely we may end that; Drew has paid for the projector, so is pleased with things
   - We frequently find we need extra cabling; may want to buy some cables and carrying case
   - Need HDMI cable
   - Budget $20 for a bag for cabling
     - Deemed discretionary spending
     - Reimburse for HDMI cable

*** Action Items From Last Month
    
*** Last Month

- September :: Myles on CouchDB, Scott on boinc, Alex on ZopeDB

**** Successes

  - Bill would kinda like to get an expanded talk on ZopeDB
  - Not terribly many speaker interruptions

**** Failures

  - The pieces were a bit too long; each could have used more than 30 minutes
  - Perhaps we should do 4 talks, which ensures people are well aware that their time is limited
  - Nice to have a timer for speakers
  - Someone responsible for timing
  - Write a policy
    - Mike has volunteered to draft something
      - Bring airhorn!!!
  - Could we use a moderator?

*** Upcoming

  - October :: AGM, reports
  - Myles would like a series of short targeted crypto talks
  - Reports
    - Chris suggests the following slots as being generally a good
      idea; no particular order necessarily implied, but they surely
      should be ordered...
    - Finances :: Chris
    - ICANN :: Gord
    - CAG :: Mike
    - ICANN - Extended :: Evan
    - Prez Report :: Scott
    - Systems/Operations :: Myles
    - Board Member Stump Time :: This probably needs to be first...
    - Election Results :: Bill

- November :: Crypto, if not in October

*** Tentative/Unconfirmed Talks

**** No Dates

- Adib Saikali :: OpenStack
- Adib Saikali :: Automating Docker
- Myles Braithwaite :: Crypto
- Dave Tilbrook :: Software Engineering
- Byron Sonne :: Suggested by DCB
- Drew Sullivan :: ~systemd~

** Mailing List

*** Action Items From Last Month

- TODO Myles :: Mail series for sunsetting TLUG list
  - One message indicating the plan
  - A weekly message until Sept 30 indicating "7 less days"
  - A final message entitled "GTALUG Mailing List Has Moved"
- TODO Myles :: Document the Operations mailing list
  - Operations should be open for interested people to request subscription
  - Intended for people participating in operating GTALUG
- TODO Myles :: Document the Board mailing list even though the subscriber list is miniscule
  - Invitation only list for active board members
- TODO Myles :: Warn people that mailing list might die somewhat randomly; look at gtalug.org if it seems dead for pointer
- Myles :: Set up email addresses
  - Scott wants one - scott@gtalug.org
  - Chris :: already there as chris@gtalug.org
  - Should we install IMAPD?
  - Set up shell account for Scott
- TODO Scott :: Subscribe GMANE to new list
- TODO Alex :: Set up Mailman archive of the old list
  - Need mailing list (Myles)
  - May need Alex to help get more data
  - Reasonable for this to wait until old list is dead
- Any? :: Should someone be monitoring root email

*** Code of Conduct
   - What are we going to do if someone breaks the Code of Conduct on the Mailing List?

*** Moderators

** Board Election
 - Need to publicize board election...
 - A perceived complexity is there being 2x2 year slots and 1x1 year
   slot
 - There does not seem to be any reason we couldn't switch that 1 slot to be filled now.
   - Bylaws do not declare any particular arrangement, not even that there be 5 board members
   - It would surely be simpler to have an election with 3 identical seats
 - Bill Thanis :: Returning Officer

** Board/Executive Members aren't reading meeting notes

*** Action Items From Last Month
- TODO Everyone :: email Scott with their address
- TODO Scott :: Check it into the Board Git site in YAML file, please provide (here!) the URL where we can access it.
