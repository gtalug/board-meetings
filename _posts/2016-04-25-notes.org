  - Seems undesirable to reserve lots of meetings in advance, as the appointments tend to get deleted

** Upcoming Meetings

*** April
  - Apparently the session went well, particularly between Myles and Trent
  - Panel seemed to go well
  - Had a clear idea of who was speaking, and drew them together in advance to make sure there were some questions planned
  - It's evident that having some questions come in early is helpful too
  - Too many panelists is not ideal; 3 was nice, 4 is a maximum
  - Are there other panels worth percolating?
    - Virtualization
    - Best distribution
      - As a guided talk, this would be interesting...
      - How do you download, install, configure, upgrade, replace, report bugs, install foreign software, round it out to a dozen items
    - Editors other than vi and Emacs    
    - Databases?
    - Tiny distros?
    - Needs to be both broad and slim enough...
    - Automation: Puppet, Chef, Ansible, CFengine, Salt
    - Devops

*** May
  - May 10th
  - General Q&A
  - Ask people about the Distribution concept
