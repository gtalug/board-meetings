** Next Board meeting

  - June 27th?
  - At Hacklab
  - Seems undesirable to reserve lots of meetings in advance, as the appointments tend to get deleted
  - Note that we should probably consider having a board meeting @ LITP, or skip that month...

** Upcoming Meetings

*** June

  Myles: Got a lead for a talk, GNU Status by Bob Jonkman. 

*** Future / Slush List

  - Myles: OpenData, Keith @ City of Toronto.
  - Scott: TPP, we've been given people to contact.
  - DaveCB: Linux TCP/IP, by himself.
  - Alvin Starr: OpenStack

*** Infrastucture
**** Hosting Provider
 - Linode is American, which makes it sensitive to US/CDN exchange rates
 - Not many Canadian vendors
 - Digital Ocean has a Toronto centre, but a low end VM that may be suitable
 - Cloud@Cost is highly undesirable
 - VMFarms, who sponsor PyCon Canada
   - Managed hosting, not VM
 - Mike K commends DreamHosts as a decent-ish managed hosting solution
 - Tentatively plan to defer the matter to next year, maybe $CDN will strengthen...

**** Mediawiki
 - Archive is now in GitHub; some pages are missing
 - Scott will see if he can spin up the disk image

**** MySQL Backups
 - Happening
 - Tested, working fine

**** Mailing Lists - Yahoo
 - Encountering some issues with subscribers at Yahoo and similar addresses
   - DMARC issue
   - Lost 40 subscribers two weeks ago, as mailman decided to drop them all
   - Myles added them back
 - The Great Unsubscribing Event of 2016
 - Fix is to add a couple things to Mailman configuration, as commended by Yahoo...
 - Would like someone on various modern free email services
   - AOL - Alex
   - Hotmail/Outlook - Myles
   - So we can monitor things

*** Ryerson Engagement
 - Email addresses now with Gord
 - Engagement can proceed
 - Myles is meeting with them on PyCon Canada stuff, so may have some insights


*** Linux in the Park

  - Myles: Has list of upcoming toronto events.
  - Myles: Will poll at the meeting for best date to hold it.
  - Scott: Will bring 10x10 gazbo.
  - Myles: Rain Day?
