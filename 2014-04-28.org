** Systems

*** Web Sites

**** Main web site

Seems to be working fine

**** Mediawiki

Offline.

We were planning to put a ~wget~ of it into a git repo to at least have a static copy available.

**** Trac

Offline.

That's where board meeting notes are, and, it being offline, we haven't got notes terribly readily available.

A ~wget~ of it would be _super_ useful.
